                <p>A new trailer for Zack Snyder’s Justice League — also known as the Snyder Cut — made an appearance in August during DC Fandome but today, the director released yet another version of the superhero team-up pic that was originally released in 2017.

For those of you who don’t know, Justice League brings together Batman (Ben Affleck), Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) as they battle the sinister Darkseid.

Set to Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”,  the new trailer was released today in color and in — wait for it — black and white! There are a couple new additions to the last trailer that was released including more scenes with Cyborg, Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) looking fierce, Aquaman going toe-to-toe with a mysterious figure and a look at the Batmobile in action. The new director’s cut of the Justice League will include new scenes with the core cast as well as Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, and Diane Lane. In addition, Jared Leto shot some new scenes as the Joker.

Justice League is set to debut on HBO Max as a four-part event series in 2021.</p>
                
                <h3>Tech News: PS5 and Xbox Series X/S restock hits Walmart at 3 p.m. ET today</h3>
                <img src="images/gamingconsole-tech.jpg" width="300px" height="200px">
                <p style="color: blueviolet">The retailer is promising that all four big new game consoles -- both versions of the PS5, the Xbox Series X  andthe  Xbox Series S -- will be available on its site at 3 p.m. ET, noon PT today (Thursday, Nov. 19). As the retailer did in the run-up to launch day, Walmart shared the news about console availability via tweet, and has updated its product pages, too. The big question: Is its site any better prepared for the massive influx of traffic expected? So many people tried to order the PS5 on its launch day, Nov. 12, that Walmart's site buckled under the traffic. </p>
